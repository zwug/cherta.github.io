<p>I was preparing myself to enter the humanities university in Uruguay to study
literature but it became really obvious to me that if I wanted <a href="https://nomadlist.com/montevideo-uruguay/cost-of-living">to rent a house and
go out at night</a>
I needed to leave my literature studies.</p>
<h3 id="first-job">First Job</h3>
<p>After a year of study, I got a job
at <a href="http://www.tcs.com/">TCS</a> a huge Indian company that was hiring
in Montevideo.</p>
<p>I worked there for almost 3 years, 2 in Uruguay and 1 in Argentina. After
that, I took a long vacation to visit some friends in Israel, one of
the best trips I&#39;ve ever made.</p>
<h3 id="consulting">Consulting</h3>
<p>Since leaving TCS, I worked as a consultant first for JEE projects and
afterwards in JavaScript and client side technologies.</p>
<p>I worked for big companies like Worldspan, Equifax among others and trained people
at UTE and Porto Seguro.</p>
<h3 id="fast-forward">Fast Forward</h3>
<p>I work for <a href="http://ingsw.com">Ingenious</a> as a frontend
developer and help organize the <a href="https://reactjsuy.now.sh">React community in Uruguay</a>.</p>
